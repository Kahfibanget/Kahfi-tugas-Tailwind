                <p>
                    Catty is a website for learning React (actually this is an assignment websiteðŸ¤“),
                    <br />
                    This website was specially designed by a CSS SEPUH named Muhammad Kahfi who is a very CSS SEPUH (just kidding!!),
                    <br />
                    So this is just a task website ordered by Ust Razak Adli Tama or SEPUH Razak,
                    <br />
                    so this is just the home page.

                <h1>Muhammad Kahfi</h1>
                <p>      
                    Muhammad Kahfi is a santri or student at BQ City IBS
                    <br />
                    Kahfi is someone who easily gets along with anyone, including students and religious teachers
                    <br />
                    Kahfi was born on November 30 2010 in the city of Jakarta, he now lives in the city of Depok
                    <br />
                    Kahfi has a VERY GOOD attitude, he's the type of person who doesn't like anyone 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    that's all my introduction
                    <br />
                    Thanks`
